Muffin: Ah! Where am I?!?!?!
Spicy: This is the Clowderville prison, you're in here for stealing others cat treats.
Muffin: WHAT DO YOU MEAN!?!?!?!? I DIDN'T STEAL ANY TREATS!!!
Spicy: We have cameras all around the city, we can see everything you do, without you even noticing.
Muffin: (Why are there cameras here?) I told you before! That wasn't me!
Spicy: *plays clip of muffin stealing treats*

Spicy: GET HER!!!
Muffin: welp I did use a random controller
Muffin: that I've never seen before to open a door without me knowing what it did.

Muffin: NO!
Spicy: Yes. Bye now.
